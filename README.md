## 🖥️ Description
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus. <br/>

## ✅ Project Rules
Create a communication program in the form of a client and a server. <br/>

• The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID. <br/>
• The client takes two parameters: <br/>
• The server PID. <br/>
• The string to send. <br/>
• The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server. Once the string has been received, the server must print it. <br/>
• The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think it takes too long, then it is probably too long. 1 second for displaying 100 characters is way too much! <br/>
• Your server should be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without needing to restart. <br/>
• The communication between your client and your server has to be done only using UNIX signals. <br/>
• You can only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. <br/>
